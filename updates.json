    "changelog": "- Romania: Mechanic NPC is no longer also selected when you get a kitchen NPC as a target, Courier MAYBE finally faces the right way? \n- Robert Knox Guard and Crest Guard no longer search map for those men, instead they will go be sad somewhere \n- Dartmoor: Adds Wrath boxreflectioncache to night variants, to hopefully fix indoors of those maps being bright red if they're loaded after you've been playing other maps \n- Sapienza: The Icon - Poorly placed buggy NPCs no longer spawn on Alerted mode, sports car exit now works properly",
