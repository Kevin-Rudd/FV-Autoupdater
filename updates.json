    "version": "1.6.2",
    "changelog": "- HOPEFULLY fixes Landslide (and other Sapienza bonus mission) exit bug \n- Fixes game crashing when The Politician - Midday is loaded \n- Integrates Peacock Plugin as an SMF option rather than separate download. You still need to grab a JSON from either website or Nexus SDK download \n- Gives Peacock Plugin support for Hawke's Bay map slot (Option must be selected in SMF). **Currently cannot select variants**, 4x Hawke's Bay variants on by default",
